## Welcome to University Project Reports of Nitin Ranjan
<hr>  <br>
I study at the VIT University, Vellore and this is a collection of all project reports I made as a student here from being a fresher to graduation day.

### Year 1 (2018-19)

- Operating Systems - [A Comparative study between 32-bit architectures vs 64-bit architectures](https://github.com/NitinR2510/Project_Reports/blob/main/OS.docx)

_The project is as the name suggests, an analysis between 32-bit and 64-bit architectures.
We assessed the architectures against benchmarks on about 5 different factors._

- Introduction to Innovative Projects - [Suggestions for a new and improved FFCS model](https://github.com/NitinR2510/Project_Reports/blob/main/IIP.pdf)

_FFCS is the method by which teachers and courses are opted in VIT.
However, the sheer number of students makes the process a very load for the University servers which are usually weak. 
We had suggested a new method to improve efficiency.
It is based on browser extensions and preplanned selection._

### Year 2 (2019-20)
- Database Management Systems - [Chatbot for mental health montoring](https://github.com/NitinR2510/Project_Reports/blob/main/DBMS.pdf)

_ICRYM is a chatbot built to behave as a friend and a monitor for the mental health of the user. It involves some really simple sentence contruction and a small language tree to contruct some conversation artificially. A website was deployed for the purpose of the same._

- Lean Startup Manangement - [Web platform for fresher interaction](https://github.com/NitinR2510/Project_Reports/blob/main/LSM.pdf)

_Similar to Quora and Twitter but for a univeristy students and teachers to interact and learn more_

### Year 3 (2020 - )
- Data Structures and Algorithms - [Hangman and the analysis of Python vs C for large datas](https://github.com/NitinR2510/Project_Reports/blob/main/DSA.pdf)

_Hangman is very popular word game. We programmed hangman with a complete dictionary word set (around 4 million) and compared the performance of the two languages. Basc Python uses list data structure while C uses Array. (while arrays are possible in both, we used it in this way for the sake of comparison)._

- Parallel and Distributed Computing - [Smith Waterman Algorithm](https://github.com/NitinR2510/Project_Reports/blob/main/PDC.pdf)

_Studying the parallelism in genetic algorithms with special emphasis on local gene sequence alignment and the Smith-Waterman Algorithm. We have tried on work on and compare CPU implementation and GPU implementation of the same._ 

- Information Security Audit and Analysis - [The Mail Encryptor](https://github.com/NitinR2510/Project_Reports/blob/main/ISAA.pdf)

_Creating a 3-layered encryption system for real time mail transfer over gmail_

- Artificial Intelligence - [Intelligent Graphologist](https://github.com/NitinR2510/Project_Reports/blob/main/AI.pdf)

_A graphologist is the one to predict a person's personality based on the person's handwriting. Our project aimed to build such a model using machine learning and develop a statistical model under limited sample population_

- Software Engineering - [Intrelligent Graphologist - Project Report](https://github.com/NitinR2510/Project_Reports/blob/main/software_pr.pdf)

_This project aimed at tracing and documenting the development involved in building the intelligent graphologist project for our 
Artificial Intelligence course. This means that this report has all the development process like dates, specifications, use cases, gnatt charts etc for the same._




### Under construction.
