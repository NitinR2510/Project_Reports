I study at the VIT University, Vellore and this is a collection of all project reports I made as a student here from being a fresher to graduation day.

### Year 1 (2018-19)

- Operating Systems - [A Comparative study between 32-bit architectures vs 64-bit architectures](https://github.com/NitinR2510/Project_Reports/blob/main/OS.docx)
```
The project is as the name suggests, an analysis between 32-bit and 64-bit architectures.
We assessed the architectures against benchmarks on about 5 different factors.

- Introduction to Innovative Projects - [Suggestions for a new and improved FFCS model](https://github.com/NitinR2510/Project_Reports/blob/main/IIP.pdf)
```
FFCS is the method by which teachers and courses are opted in VIT.
However, the sheer number of students makes the process a very load for the University servers which are usually weak. 
We had suggested a new method to improve efficiency.
It is based on browser extensions and preplanned selection.
