I am Nitin Ranjan. And I study at the VIT University, Vellore. It's a beautiful place, and I have a lot of fun as a student there; but this page is about my projects - and they make us do a lot of them!

_So, anyways, stranger, this is a collection of all project reports I made as a student here from being a fresher to graduation day._

### Year 1 (2018-19)

- Operating Systems - [A Comparative study between 32-bit architectures vs 64-bit architectures](https://github.com/NitinR2510/Project_Reports/blob/main/OS.docx)

_The project is as the name suggests, an analysis between 32-bit and 64-bit architectures.
We assessed the architectures against benchmarks on about 5 different factors._

- Introduction to Innovative Projects - [Suggestions for a new and improved FFCS model](https://github.com/NitinR2510/Project_Reports/blob/main/IIP.pdf)

_FFCS is the method by which teachers and courses are opted in VIT.
However, the sheer number of students makes the process a very load for the University servers which are usually weak. 
We had suggested a new method to improve efficiency.
It is based on browser extensions and preplanned selection._

### Year 2 (2019-20)
- Database Management Systems - [Chatbot for mental health montoring](https://github.com/NitinR2510/Project_Reports/blob/main/DBMS.pdf)

_ICRYM is a chatbot built to behave as a friend and a monitor for the mental health of the user. It involves some really simple sentence contruction and a small language tree to contruct some conversation artificially. A website was deployed for the purpose of the same._

- Lean Startup Manangement - [Web platform for fresher interaction](https://github.com/NitinR2510/Project_Reports/blob/main/LSM.pdf)

_Similar to Quora and Twitter but for a univeristy students and teachers to interact and learn more_

### Year 3 (2020 - 21)
- Data Structures and Algorithms - [Hangman and the analysis of Python vs C for large datas](https://github.com/NitinR2510/Project_Reports/blob/main/DSA.pdf)

_Hangman is very popular word game. We programmed hangman with a complete dictionary word set (around 4 million) and compared the performance of the two languages. Basc Python uses list data structure while C uses Array. (while arrays are possible in both, we used it in this way for the sake of comparison)._

- Parallel and Distributed Computing - [Smith Waterman Algorithm](https://github.com/NitinR2510/Project_Reports/blob/main/PDC.pdf)

_Studying the parallelism in genetic algorithms with special emphasis on local gene sequence alignment and the Smith-Waterman Algorithm. We have tried on work on and compare CPU implementation and GPU implementation of the same._ 

- Information Security Audit and Analysis - [The Mail Encryptor](https://github.com/NitinR2510/Project_Reports/blob/main/ISAA.pdf)

_Creating a 3-layered encryption system for real time mail transfer over gmail_

- Artificial Intelligence - [Intelligent Graphologist](https://github.com/NitinR2510/Project_Reports/blob/main/AI.pdf)

_A graphologist is the one to predict a person's personality based on the person's handwriting. Our project aimed to build such a model using machine learning and develop a statistical model under limited sample population_

- Software Engineering - [Intelligent Graphologist - Project Report](https://github.com/NitinR2510/Project_Reports/blob/main/software_pr.pdf)

_This project aimed at tracing and documenting the development involved in building the intelligent graphologist project for our 
Artificial Intelligence course. This means that this report has all the development process like dates, specifications, use cases, gnatt charts etc for the same._

- Information Security Management - [Studying Brute Force Attacks and methodologies to mitigate them](https://github.com/NitinR2510/Project_Reports/blob/main/INFORMATION%20SECURITY%20MANAGEMENT.pdf)

_This project aims at evaluating various brute force attacks and statistically evaluating them, attack methodologies and preventive measures for the same_

- Image Processing - [Image Stegnalysis through Deep Learning and LSB](https://github.com/NitinR2510/Project_Reports/blob/main/IMAGE%20PROCESSING.pdf)

_A research article that aims at better identifying ways to use RESNET-50 for image stegnalysis. The paper makes a simple addition of LSB filtering and then establish a comparison between transfer learning and non-transfer learning aided models of the same_

- Internet of Things - [Smart Office for COVID care](https://github.com/NitinR2510/Project_Reports/blob/main/IOT.pdf)


_Keeping in mind the spread of COVID and the associated social distancing protocols and the fall in productivity associated with the same, the project aims at creating a model office that allows social distancing and increased productivity by introducing fun activities in the same. This is achieved using IoT and a detailed cost analysis has also been carried out with the same._

- Social and Information Networks - [Visualising Live Tweets](https://github.com/NitinR2510/Project_Reports/blob/main/SOCIAL_INFORMATION_NETWORKS.pdf)


_Live Tweet Analysis using Python and then visualising the same on various metrics and ML_

- Internet and Web Programming -[Project Sahyog-A report](https://github.com/NitinR2510/Project_Reports/blob/main/IWP.pdf)


_Please check the already existing Repository on Project Sahyog on this account. But to brief about it, it was an online platform for the supply of medical commodities in the early June of 2020 when they were in an acute shortage_

- Data Visualisation -[Visualising Water levels and Rainfall Patterns for Chennai over 10 years](https://github.com/NitinR2510/Project_Reports/blob/main/DATA_VISUALISATION.pdf)


_Using Tableau and Python, the said work was performed. Various statistical measurements were made, hypothesis established and further rainfall patterns predicted_

### Year 4(2021-2022)

- Technical Answers to Real World Problems -[]

[<i>Visualising global Data</i>](https://public.tableau.com/views/EnergyTrendsViz/CoverPage?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

- Microprocessors and Interfacing -[]

### Under construction.
